# Gnuplot-C-Interface

# Author: Efrain Vasques

# General Overview: 
Purpose of the program is to provide an interface between C and the Gnuplot terminal plotting environment. Through Unix system calls, Gnuplot is run through the standard
terminal and execute Gnuplot terminal commands. The user is asked to input the name of the file to create, write to with desired data
and then call the Gnuplot plot function to plot said newly created file.

Currently I am working on adding the feature of generating PNG graphs along with the terminal graph.
